<p>Some types in Python can be modified after creation (mutable), while others cannot (immutable). This distinction is crucial for understanding how Python works. Key to this is understanding the difference between reassignment and mutation.</p>

<h2>Mutation</h2>

<p>Mutation changes the contents of an existing object and can only be performed on mutable types.</p>

<py-cell>my_list = [1, 2, 3]
print(my_list)
my_list[0] = 10  # Change the contents of the existing list
print(my_list)
</py-cell>

It is not possible to change the contents of an immutable object. For example, you cannot change a character in a string:

<py-cell>message="hello"
message[0] = "H"
</py-cell>

<h2>Reassignment</h2>

<p>Reassignment of a variable changes the variable to refer to a different object (this can be done for immutable or mutable types):</p>

<py-cell>x = 5
x = 10
print(x)

y = [1, 2, 3]
y = [4, 5, 6] # Create a new list object
print(y)
</py-cell>

<h2>Multiple References</h2>

<p>When multiple variables refer to the same mutable object, mutation of that object can be seen from any variable referencing that object:</p>

<py-cell>x = "hello"
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = list1
list2[0] = 10
print(list1)</py-cell>

Multiple variables can also refer to the same immutable object, but since it cannot be changed, we can only reassign the variable, which does not affect the object the other variables reference:

<py-cell>x = "hello"
y = x
y = "goodbye" # This creates a new string object, x still references "hello"
print(x)
print(y)</py-cell>
